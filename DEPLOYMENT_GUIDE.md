## 🚨 Quick Troubleshooting

**"My GitHub Pages link shows 404"**
→ Wait 2-3 minutes after enabling Pages
→ Make sure `index.html` is in the root directory (not in a subfolder)
→ Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R

**"Chatbot doesn't work on deployed site"**
→ Check browser console (F12) for errors
→ Verify all file names are correct (case-sensitive!)
→ Make sure all files were uploaded

**"Google Sheets not working"**
→ That's okay! The chatbot still works perfectly
→ Mention in submission: "Google Sheets integration ready for your Apps Script URL"
