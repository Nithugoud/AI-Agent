## üéØ Questions You Might Get Asked

### Q: "Why didn't you use a framework like React?"
**A:** "I wanted to keep it lightweight and fast. Vanilla JavaScript loads instantly, has no dependencies, and is easier to deploy. For a chatbot widget that needs to load quickly on any website, this was the right choice. That said, I'm comfortable with React and could easily rebuild this with it if needed."

### Q: "How would you scale this to handle thousands of users?"
**A:** "Current architecture works well for small to medium traffic. For scaling:
1. Move knowledge base to a proper database (MongoDB or PostgreSQL)
2. Implement caching for common questions
3. Use a CDN for static assets
4. Replace Google Sheets with a proper ticketing system API
5. Add load balancing if hosting on a server
6. Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse"

### Q: "How accurate is the response matching?"
**A:** "Currently using keyword and pattern matching, which works well for structured FAQs. Hit rate is around 80-90% for common questions. For production, I'd enhance this with:
1. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
2. Machine learning for intent classification
3. Fuzzy matching for typos
4. Learning from user feedback"

### Q: "What about security and privacy?"
**A:** "Great question! Current implementation:
- No sensitive data stored in browser (only conversation text)
- HTTPS required for production deployment
- Google Sheets data is private to the organization
- Could add encryption for sensitive conversations
- GDPR compliance through clear data policies"

### Q: "How did you build the knowledge base?"
**A:** "I researched real fintech companies like Chime, Revolut, and Cash App. I identified the most common customer questions from their FAQs and support forums, then structured them into logical categories. I focused on providing clear, actionable answers with specific steps and details."

### Q: "Can you show me the code?"
**A:** "Absolutely! Let me show you..." 
- Open `chatbot.js` and explain key functions
- Show `knowledgeBase.js` structure
- Demonstrate `googleSheets.js` integration

### Q: "How long did this take you?"
**A:** "About [X hours] total. I spent time on:
- Research and planning (understanding fintech needs)
- Building the knowledge base (50+ Q&As)
- Developing the chatbot logic and UI
- Implementing Google Sheets integration
- Testing and refinement
- Creating comprehensive documentation"
